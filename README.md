Othello Game with AI Implementation

Description:
Developed an interactive Othello game using Python and Pygame, incorporating both human and AI players. Implemented a sophisticated AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to optimize decision-making and improve gameplay difficulty.

Technologies Used:
- Python: Core programming language.
- Pygame: Library for creating the game's graphical user interface and handling user inputs.
- Algorithms: Minimax with alpha-beta pruning for AI decision-making.
  
Key Features:
- Interactive GUI allowing human players to place tokens and view game state.
- AI player with adjustable difficulty, leveraging depth-limited Minimax algorithm.
- Dynamic game grid updating and visualization of token placement and flips.
- Score tracking and game state management ensuring accurate and real-time feedback.
